# CS-300-Client-Side-Web-Dev---Final-Project-

Final project for my cousre work. We had to create a Website. 
A local Dojo asked to the teacher if her students were interested in redesigning thier website. 
My group decided to take part in redesign of website. 
At the end of class our design was shown  to the Dojo and we were picked as the best design.
